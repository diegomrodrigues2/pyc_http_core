I can see you're encountering a pytest configuration error. The issue is that your `pyproject.toml` file has an `--asyncio-mode=auto` argument that's not being recognized by your current pytest version.

Let me examine your project configuration to understand the issue better:


I can see the issue! You have both `--asyncio-mode=auto` in the `addopts` list and `asyncio_mode = "auto"` as a separate configuration option. This is causing a conflict. The `--asyncio-mode=auto` argument is not a valid pytest command-line option.

Let me also check your test file to see if it uses async tests:


Now I can see the issue clearly. Your test file doesn't contain any async tests, but your `pyproject.toml` has conflicting asyncio configuration. The problem is:

1. You have `--asyncio-mode=auto` in the `addopts` list, which is not a valid pytest command-line option
2. You also have `asyncio_mode = "auto"` as a separate configuration option

Here's the fix for your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml:pyproject.toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
python_classes = ["Test*"]
python_functions = ["test_*"]
addopts = [
    "--strict-markers",
    "--strict-config",
]
asyncio_mode = "auto"
```

The key changes:
1. **Remove** `--asyncio-mode=auto` from the `addopts` list (this is not a valid command-line option)
2. **Keep** `asyncio_mode = "auto"` as a separate configuration option (this is the correct way to configure asyncio mode)

After making this change, your pytest command should work correctly. The `asyncio_mode = "auto"` setting will automatically detect and handle async tests if you add them in the future, but it won't interfere with your current synchronous tests.

Try running the tests again after making this change:

```bash
pytest tests/test_http_primitives.py
```

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
python_classes = ["Test*"]
python_functions = ["test_*"]
addopts = [
    "--strict-markers",
    "--strict-config",
]
asyncio_mode = "auto"
```

```shellscript
pytest tests/test_http_primitives.py
```

I see there are two issues now:

1. The `asyncio_mode` configuration option is not recognized by your pytest version
2. The `c_http_core` module cannot be imported because it's not installed in development mode

Let me fix both issues:


Now I need to fix both issues. Here are the solutions:

## Issue 1: Fix pytest configuration

Your pytest version (7.4.3) doesn't recognize the `asyncio_mode` option. Let's remove it since you don't have async tests yet:

```toml:pyproject.toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
python_classes = ["Test*"]
python_functions = ["test_*"]
addopts = [
    "--strict-markers",
    "--strict-config"
]
```

## Issue 2: Install the package in development mode

You need to install your package in development mode so that the tests can import it. Run this command in your project root:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This will install your `c_http_core` package in "editable" mode, which means:
- The package will be available for import
- Any changes you make to the source code will be immediately available without reinstalling
- The tests will be able to import `c_http_core`

## Complete solution:

1. **Update your `pyproject.toml`** to remove the `asyncio_mode` line:

```toml:pyproject.toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
python_classes = ["Test*"]
python_functions = ["test_*"]
addopts = [
    "--strict-markers",
    "--strict-config"
]
```

2. **Install the package in development mode**:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

3. **Run the tests**:

```bash
pytest
```

After making these changes, your tests should run successfully. The `pip install -e .` command is essential for development - it makes your package importable while allowing you to modify the code without reinstalling.

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
python_classes = ["Test*"]
python_functions = ["test_*"]
addopts = [
    "--strict-markers",
    "--strict-config"
]
```

```shellscript
pip install -e .
```

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
python_classes = ["Test*"]
python_functions = ["test_*"]
addopts = [
    "--strict-markers",
    "--strict-config"
]
```

```shellscript
pip install -e .
```

```shellscript
pytest
```
